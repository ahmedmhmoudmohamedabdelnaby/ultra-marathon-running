Ultra-Marathon Race Data Analysis Using Python
Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of ultra-marathon race records spanning from 1798 to 2022, containing a large collection of 7,461,226 race entries from 1,641,168 unique athletes. The data was obtained from public websites and anonymized to ensure privacy, with each athlete assigned a unique Athlete ID.

The dataset includes the following columns:

Year of Event: The year in which the event took place.
Event Dates: The exact dates of the event.
Event Name: The name of the event, often including the country location.
Event Distance/Length: The distance or duration of the race (e.g., 50km, 100km, 24h, 6d).
Event Number of Finishers: The number of participants who completed the race.
Athlete Performance: The result or finishing time of the athlete.
Athlete Club: The club or team of the athlete.
Athlete Country: The country of origin of the athlete.
Athlete Year of Birth: The birth year of the athlete.
Athlete Gender: The gender of the athlete.
Athlete Age Category: The age category of the athlete (e.g., Adult, Senior).
Athlete Average Speed: The average speed of the athlete during the race (in km/h).
Athlete ID: A unique identifier for each athlete.
Python Analysis
For the analysis, I utilized Python to process and derive key insights from the dataset, including:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Anonymizing athlete names and handling missing values.
Extracting additional information from the "Event Name" (e.g., country location) and "Event Dates" (e.g., season of the event).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Examining the distribution of race distances, event participation, and athlete demographics.
Analyzing trends over time in race participation and performance.
Performance Analysis:
Investigating correlations between athlete age, gender, and race performance.
Comparing average speeds for different distances and race lengths.
Visualization:
Creating visualizations for trends such as race completion rates, average speed distributions, and participation growth over the years.
Statistical Analysis:
Identifying significant trends in ultra-marathon racing and athlete performance.
Analyzing the impact of event length and type on athlete performance.
Key Insights
Trends in Ultra-Marathon Participation: How participation in ultra-marathons has grown over the centuries.
Performance Insights: How age and gender affect race performance, as well as the impact of event length on athlete speed.
Event Popularity: Identifying the most popular ultra-marathon distances and their global reach.
Seasonal Trends: Analyzing how different seasons influence race results and participation.
Project Outcome
By utilizing Python for data processing, cleaning, and analysis, I was able to extract meaningful insights from a vast dataset, uncovering trends and performance patterns in ultra-marathon races. This analysis provides valuable insights for future events, athletes, and researchers in the field of sports analytics.
